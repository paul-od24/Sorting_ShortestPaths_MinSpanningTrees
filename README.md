# Sorting_ShortestPaths_MinSpanningTrees

This repository contains implementations of three sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. 
The code provided allows for computing the running times of these sorting algorithms for a given input list A with x integer elements. 
It is important to note that the input list A should be initially sorted in reverse order (descending order) before running the sorting algorithms.

# Task 1: Sorting Algorithms Implementation
The first task involves setting up and implementing the three sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. 
These algorithms are fundamental sorting techniques widely used in computer science.

# Task 2: Applying Dijkstras's Algorithm
The task involves applying Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from vertex A to vertex G in the given weighted graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm that efficiently calculates the minimum path length between two vertices in a graph.

# Task 3: Applying Prim's Algorithm
The task involves applying Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for the given problem.
